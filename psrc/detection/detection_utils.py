Module for detection utilities.

This module provides helper functions for card detection tasks, including computing the overlap ratio between 
bounding boxes and grouping detected cards into hands based on spatial relationships.

  Computes the overlap ratio between two axis-aligned bounding boxes.
  
  Each bounding box is defined as [x1, y1, x2, y2]. The function returns the ratio of the intersection area to 
  the area of the smaller box.
  
  Parameters:
    boxA (list or tuple of float): Coordinates [x1, y1, x2, y2] for the first box.
    boxB (list or tuple of float): Coordinates [x1, y1, x2, y2] for the second box.

  """
  Groups bounding boxes into hands based on their overlap.
  
  Each bounding box (expressed as [x1, y1, x2, y2]) is treated as a node in a graph. An edge is added between two
  nodes if their overlap (computed via compute_overlap) is at least the overlap threshold. A depth-first search
  (DFS) is then used to find connected components, where each component represents a hand.
  
  Parameters:
    boxes (list): A list of bounding boxes.
    overlap_threshold (float, optional): Minimum overlap ratio to connect two boxes. Defaults to 0.1.
  
  Returns:
    list: A list of groups, where each group is a list of indices corresponding to bounding boxes that form a hand.
