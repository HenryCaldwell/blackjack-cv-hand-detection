def calculate_hand_score(cards):
  """
  Calculate the total score of a blackjack hand.

  This function computes the hand's score by iterating through each card and adding its value. Face cards
  (non-digit and non-Ace cards) are assigned a value of 10, while numeric cards are converted directly to their
  integer value. Aces are initially counted as 1, then adjusted to 11 if it does not cause the score to exceed 21.

  Parameters:
    cards (list of str): The hand of cards, where each card is represented as a string (e.g., "A", "4", "J").

  Returns:
    int: The total score of the hand according to blackjack rules.
