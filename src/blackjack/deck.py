"""
Module for managing a deck of playing cards.

This module provides a CardDeck class that tracks the count of each card in a standard deck. Each card 
(A, 2-10, J, Q, K) is initialized with 4 copies (scaled by deck size). The class maintains a running count using
the Hi-Lo system and offers methods for removing a card, retrieving the current counts of cards, and getting both
the running and true counts.
