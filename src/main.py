"""
Module for card detection and evaluation in a blackjack context.

This module defines the BlackjackVisionAnalyzer class, which integrates video capture, object detection using a
YOLO model, card tracking, hand grouping, EV (expected value) evaluation, and frame annotation. It uses various
utility modules to process video frames, detect playing cards, evaluate blackjack hands, and display annotated
results.

  Main application class for card detection, hand evaluation, and game state tracking

  loads the YOLO model for card detection, sets up a card tracker to maintain detection consistency,
  manages a deck of cards for blackjack, and evaluates the expected value (EV) of various actions
  for player hands. It also processes video frames by annotating them with detection and evaluation data.
