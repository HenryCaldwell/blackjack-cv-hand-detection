"""
Module for configuration management.

This module provides a Config class that centralizes all configurable parameters used throughout the card
detection application. Parameters include thresholds for grouping, detection, and tracking, as well as file paths,
update intervals, and frame sizes.

    Initializes a new configuration instance with default parameter values.
    
    Attributes:
      yolo_path (str): File path to the YOLO weights.

      use_webcam (bool): Flag to use webcam stream vs video file.
      webcam_index (int): Index of the webcam to use (0 for default).
      video_path (str): File path to the input video.
      inference_interval (float): Seconds between inference updates.
      inference_frame_size (tuple): Resolution (width, height) for the frame used during inference.

      overlap_threshold (float): Threshold for grouping cards into hands.
      inference_overlap_threshold (float): Overlap threshold for non-max suppression and tracking.
      confidence_threshold (float): Minimum confidence required to consider a detection.

      confirmation_frames (int): Number of consecutive frames required to confirm a card label.
      disappear_frames (int): Number of frames a card can be missing before it is dropped.

      deck_size (int): Number of decks in play.
