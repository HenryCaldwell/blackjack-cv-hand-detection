"""
Module for tracking card detections across frames.

This module provides a CardTracker class that encapsulates the logic for tracking detected cards over consecutive 
frames. It ensures that a card label is confirmed only after being stable for a specified number of frames, and 
manages detections that momentarily disappear.

    Initializes the CardTracker with the specified tracking parameters.
    
    Parameters:
      confirmation_frames (int): Number of consecutive frames required to confirm a card label.
      disappear_frames (int): Number of frames a card can be missing before it is forgotten.
      confidence_threshold (float): Minimum confidence required to start tracking a detection.

    Updates the tracking of detected cards with the latest frame data.
    
    This method matches new detections to previously tracked cards based on overlap. If a detection is matched 
    and has been stable for the required number of frames, the stable label is used; otherwise, the new label is applied.
    It also handles detections that are temporarily missing.
    
    Parameters:
      boxes (list): List of bounding boxes for current detections.
      labels (list): List of labels corresponding to the boxes.
      confidences (list): List of confidence scores for each detection.
